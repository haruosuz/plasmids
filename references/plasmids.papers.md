Abstract
Quasi-metagenomics with nanopore sequencing provided thousands of high-contiguity genomes, phage and plasmid sequences (>60% novel), enabling characterization of resistome and mobilome diversity and dynamic architectures in hospital environments.

Fig. 4. Species distribution and genomic proximity of drug resistance genes in the hospital-environment microbiome.

Genomic proximity network and clustering of ARGs based on 2,347 microbial genomes and 5,910 closed plasmid sequences obtained from the hospital environment. a, Multigraph of genomic proximity between ARGs.

Performing a similar analysis for closed plasmids, we first clustered them into shared backbones and annotated them for known hosts (identity ≥ 95%; Methods). By analyzing ARGs in this context, we found that many ARGs were variably present in backbones (93 of 143). For ARGs stably found in one backbone, many were variably present in another backbone (19 of 31), highlighting the dynamic nature of ARG combinations from plasmids in the hospital environment (Fig. 4b).

Genome assembly and species assignment
Nanopore reads for each plate were assembled using Canu64 (v1.3 and v1.7; genomeSize = 8 m). For samples where both Illumina and nanopore reads were available, a higher-quality hybrid assembly was obtained using OPERA-MS19 (v0.8.3; --polish --no-gap-filling --short-read-assembler spades). Assembled contigs were mapped to the NCBI nt database with BLAST (v2.2.28), to identify microbial species or plasmid assignments according to the best BLAST hit (highest total reference coverage).

Similarly, novel circular plasmids were identified by comparing to the PLSDB36 database with Mash distance and identifying clusters at 99% identity (single linkage) with no known sequence.

Analysis of ARG combinations
ARGs were annotated to contigs by mapping them to the ARG-ANNOT70 database provided in SRST2 (v3) with BLAST (best hit with >90% identity and >90% reference coverage). ARG combinations present in chromosomes and plasmid sequences were considered novel when they were not found in the reference databases (nt or PLSDB36). Assembled circular plasmids were clustered and annotated based on their best BLAST hit with identity >95% and >60% query coverage. A bipartite graph was constructed by connecting each plasmid cluster to ARGs found in it, with edge weights representing the frequency of occurrence (clusters with <5 representatives were excluded).

Chromids Aid Genome Expansion and Functional Diversification in the Family Burkholderiaceae
George C diCenzo 1, Alessio Mengoni 1, Elena Perrin 1
https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/36/3/562/5273485
The genomes of about 10% of bacterial species display a multipartite structure, consisting of a chromosome plus one or more large additional replicons of at least 350 kb (Harrison et al. 2010; diCenzo and Finan 2017). The presence of a plasmid (nonessential replicon less than 350 kb in size) is not sufficient for a genome to be designated as multipartite. The large secondary replicons (i.e., the nonchromosomal replicons) can be essential (termed “chromid”) or nonessential (termed “megaplasmid”), and the primary features of these replicons and multipartite genomes have been reviewed recently (diCenzo and Finan 2017).

Replicon and Secondary Replicon
We suggest that each replicon be classified into one of the following five groups, as described below and in Fig. 1: chromosome, second chromosome, chromid, megaplasmid, and plasmid.

While any size limitation is essentially arbitrary, we suggest a lower cutoff of 350 kb for megaplasmid status, as this is equal to roughly 10% of the median bacterial genome size. Any nonessential replicon of <350 kb would therefore be a plasmid.

We then identified those positively or negatively associated with the trait (quinolone resistance) while accounting for the phylogenetic structure of the data using a linear mixed model (LMM) (see Methods section). 

We used all E. coli sequence type (ST) 131 (ST131) genomes from RefSeq (n = 85), and we retrieved all available E. coli ST 410 and 167 (ST410 and ST167) genomes from Enterobase (n = 1,000 and n = 801) (last accessed in December 2021) (Zhou et al. 2020). 

Genome-Wide Association Study
We performed a GWAS for the presence of fluoroquinolone resistance using 1,268 E. coli genomes with pyseer v.1.3.9 (Lees et al. 2018). The association between the gene presence/absence and the resistance phenotype (defined by the presence of a known resistance mutation) was assessed with an LMM in which the STs were considered as covariates. We used the recombination-free phylogenetic tree produced by Gubbins. This tree allowed us to generate a distance and a kinship matrix with the scripts coming with pyseer. The LMM used the multidimensional scaling (MDS) of these matrices to control for population structure.

Furthermore, this classification system can be applied to partial data, e.g., from metagenomics, because it requires the identification of a single gene.
 evolution of conjugation and T4SS


Conjugation of dsDNA takes place in mycelia-producing Actinobacteria (Grohmann et al. 2003; Ghinet et al. 2011). It relies on a single protein: TraBpSG5 that translocates dsDNA between neighboring cells in mycelia (Possoz et al. 2001). This protein resembles, in sequence and function, the essential protein FtsK that segregates sister chromosomes in the last stages of chromosomal replication (Bigot et al. 2007; Vogelmann et al. 2011).

「プラスミドパラドックス」
compensated mutation（代償的変異）
以上のことは，少なくとも複数のプラスミドの宿主は，たとえ選択圧がなくとも，染色体・プラスミドの遺伝子に代償的変異を生じさせ，プラスミドを「生き残らせる」よう進化することを示唆している．

- Host-range of plasmids in the all-microbial index
The distribution of different versions of the machinery for conjugation of DNA between bacteria has previously been analysed in 1,124 genomes39 using sensitive, but slow, protein profile searches for relaxase (MOB) and type 4 secretion system (T4SS) genes. 
- Plasmid search and exclusion of contaminated datasets
2,826 plasmid sequences were taken from the ENA plasmid pages (www.ebi.ac.uk/genomes/plasmid.html; December 2016) (See Supplementary Data 2) and downloaded from the ENA. 
- Conjugative system search
MOB (MOB_B, MOB_C, MOB_CQ, MOB_F, MOB_H, MOB_P,MOB_T, MOB_V) and T4SS sequences (VirB4_TRaU, VirD4_TcpA) as defined in Guglielmini et al 39 and Supplementary Data 8 in the all-microbial-index with T=100%. Full search results are available in Supplementary Data 9. Results were filtered for bacteria and contamination following the same method as described in “Plasmid search”. Accessions with at least one MOB and T4SS were said to contain a putative conjugative system. BIGSI does not return copy number, or location on chromosome or plasmid, so it was not possible to determine if the genes were co-located on a chromosome or on a plasmid.
- MCR-1,2,3
We searched for MCR-1, MCR-2, MCR-3 in the all-microbial-index using k-mer percent threshold T=100%. See Supplementary Data 1 for sequences and results.

Functions predict horizontal gene transfer and the emergence of antibiotic resistance

INTRODUCTION

Genome content, such as the presence of specific plasmid replicon and mobilization machinery or shared phage structural proteins, also defines gene flow across microbial species (4–6), whereas restriction-modification genes, the presence of CRISPR-Cas9 adaptive immune systems, and toxin-antitoxin systems serve as barriers to gene flow.

RESULTS

Transfer involving antibiotic resistance determinants is predictable by orthogonal functions

Fig. 3. The transfer of ARGs genes is predictable.

Despite the concern over multidrug-resistant plasmids, only 8729 edges in the network involved more than one ARG class (fig. S14A).

In addition, genes involved in the machinery and process of HGT were also identified: plasmid-segregation systems (e.g., parM), components of type IV coupling systems demarcating plasmid lineages (virD4), phage proteins (xtmB and rstA1), and proteins involved in recombination (xerC, rmuC, ruvC, and recU). We suspect that these barriers to HGT delimit subnetworks where genes are closely associated with specific transposable elements, phage, or plasmid lineages (37–39), as is the case of more recently mobilized colistin-resistance genes (40).

DISCUSSION

This framework may be leveraged to improve the design of mobile genetic elements intended for engineering the microbiome (44) or inform strategies to reduce ARG burden by curing or eliminating plasmids or inhibiting conjugation.

Evolution of Plasmid-Mediated Antibiotic Resistance in the Clinical Context

In vitro experimental work in the field is being complemented by bioinformatics and systems biology approaches, and a recent computational analysis provided the first population-level evidence of adaptation to the carriage of AR plasmids in a pathogenic E. coli lineage through mutations in gene-regulatory regions [33]. Given the increasing number of bacterial genome sequences available, a combination of this type of detailed phylogenetic analysis with genome-wide association studies [34] could identify specific loci or mutations associated with plasmid carriage. These powerful computational tools will help to define the genetic basis of plasmid–bacterium adaptation on a broader scale.
By combining the experimental and computational approaches described here, it should be possible to define molecular signatures and use them to forecast (i) the ‘fitness compatibility’ between plasmid and bacterium, and (ii) the susceptibility of these associations to compensatory evolution. These signatures could then be used to predict which plasmid–bacterium associations are likely to arise in the future from the plasmids and bacteria currently present in a given environment.

薬剤耐性プラスミドの宿主適応

本現象の背景にある分子機構を解明するため、ある宿主集団内で進化した進化型プラスミドの配列を決定したのち、進化型プラスミドを先祖型宿主に戻す実験を行ったところ、プラスミド存続性の向上がプラスミド の複製タンパク質（TrfA1）のN末の変異に依存していることがわかりました。このTrfAのN末は宿主のDnaBヘリカーゼと結合する部位であることが知られていました。生化学、分子遺伝学実験の結果から、プラスミ ドが宿主の中で複製できる場合、「宿主のDNAヘリカーゼとプラスミドとの相互作用の度合いが、プラスミドの細菌集団内での存続性を決める要因の一つ、フィットネス・コストの正体である」ことがわかりました（Yano et al., Mol. Microbiol. 2016)。

タンパク質のN末の長さ多型の意義

上記の進化実験では、複製開始タンパク質に集中的に変異が入りましたが、類似の変異がデータベースに登録されている他のプラスミドにも見つかることに研究の過程で気づきました。そこで、得られた変異体プラ スミドの表現型を様々な角度から解析することで、 プラスミドに見られる複製開始タンパク質遺伝子の5’-endの長さの多様性（in/del) が、genetic driftではなくトレード・オフの関係にある形質（この場合は水平伝播 と垂直伝播）に対するnatural selectionの結果として説明できるというアイデアを提案しました（Yano et al., J. Bacteriol. 2012)。TrfAのN末の多型のような長さ多型は他のタンパク質（遺伝子座）にも見かけられま す。他のタンパク質に関しても、N末の長さ多型にには何か重要な意味があるのではないでしょうか。

4.2 Plasmid host ranges 

Three different host ranges of plasmids are defined through the duration and
intimacy of the considered plasmid-host relationship (Suzuki et al., 2010). 

The evolutionary host range describes the variety of organisms in which a given plasmid was maintained long enough to undergo adaptation of its backbone to the genetic code of its host organism
(Suzuki et al., 2010) (Figure 4).

Why genes evolve faster on secondary chromosomes in bacteria.
Cooper VS1, Vohr SH, Wrocklage SC, Hatcher PJ.
Further, in every bacterial genome with multiple chromosomes that we studied, genes on secondary chromosomes exhibited significantly weaker codon usage bias than those on primary chromosomes. Faster evolution and reduced codon bias could in turn result from global effects of chromosome position, as genes on secondary chromosomes experience reduced dosage and expression due to their delayed replication, or selection on specific gene attributes.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2848543/
Why many bacteria have multiple chromosomes is largely unknown, but a leading hypothesis is that secondary chromosomes evolved from plasmids and now serve as accessory genomes. 
Chromosomes may originate by three different mechanisms: by the split of a single chromosome, by chromosome duplication, or by acquisition of a large plasmid with essential genes, which ensures its prolonged maintenance. Of these processes, the last has the greatest support because some secondary chromosomes have plasmid-like origins of replication [2]. 

A fourth possible mechanism is that secondary chromosomes could experience inherently higher mutation rates. Although mutation rates are known to vary among genome locations, such a widespread and systematic difference would be exceptional. The delayed replication of secondary chromosomes could potentially produce such an effect if nucleotide pools vary or become limiting as a function of the cell cycle [37] or if the replication apparatus tends to require reassembly in later replication stages, which is mutagenic [38]. The probable origin of secondary chromosomes as plasmids could also lead to increased mutation rates as a consequence of their greater supercoiling, which has been associated with greater rates of mutation [39]. Of the four potential explanations that we suggest for why secondary chromosomes evolve more quickly, this one (a systematically greater mutation rate) is the most speculative but also the most experimentally tractable.

Network analyses structure genetic diversity in independent genetic worlds.
Halary S1, Leigh JW, Cheaib B, Lopez P, Bapteste E.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2806761/
- Mathematical studies of the centralities of these worlds’ subnetworks demonstrate that plasmids, not viruses, were key vectors of genetic exchange between bacterial chromosomes, both recently and in the past.
- Most interestingly, these bridges were almost always plasmids in our networks (Fig. 2), strongly suggesting that these vehicles, and not viruses, are key vectors in the spreading of DNA in nature. Interestingly, many of these plasmids with a remarkable betweenness—although diverse in size, G+C content, and percentage of coding genes—were already known for their phylogenetic mosaicism, the presence of mobile elements such as transposons and integrons in their genomes (resulting from recombination events), and their resistance to drugs and/or heavy metals, which likely contributed to their diffusion in various hosts and environments (Table S5). For instance, pB10 [degree (d) = 63, betweenness (b) = 2,358, in the 100% identity network] is a promiscuous IncP-1 plasmid, isolated from a waste water treatment plant. Its recombined mosaic backbone structure encompasses 5 distinct mobile genetic elements. pB10 is able to self-transfer among diverse bacterial species and confers resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents and to inorganic mercury ions, and would play a major role in rapid adaptation of bacterial communities to changing environments (21).

RESULTS
Many plasmids and viruses are also found in agreement with the known molecular mechanisms of horizontal transfer (Table 1 and Supplementary Material 1).

DISCUSSION
Potential donors
Numerous viruses and plasmids qualify as potential donors (Tables 1 and ​and5,5, Supplementary Materials 1, 2, 4 and 6). It is not really surprising since they are known as HT vectors. They are often totally or partially inserted together with transferred genes in the host genome (14).

For most species, the HT model predicted the plasmid or phage genes more effectively than the non-HT model. These observations imply that in many cases, the horizontally transferred genes were initially inserted into plasmids or phages and then introgressed into the recipient species. For Borrelia burgdorferi plasmids, however, all indices were higher with the non-HT model than the HT model, implying that the genes have been settled in B. burgdorferi for a long time and that their nucleotide compositions became similar to those of the host chromosomes by amelioration14.

Genomic signature profiling further suggested that the transfer was plasmid mediated and that the operon originated from a γ-proteobacterium donor species.

Interestingly, ∼30% of the most closely related sequences are plasmid borne, suggesting a possible plasmid-mediated transfer.
