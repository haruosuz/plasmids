ABSTRACT
Complete nucleotide sequencing followed by phylogenetic analyses based on the relaxase gene traI showed that all the plasmids belong to one of two subgroups (β and ε) of the well-studied incompatibility group IncP-1. A diverse array of accessory genes was found to be involved in resistance to antimicrobials (streptomycin, spectinomycin, and sulfonamides), degradation of herbicides (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenoxypropionic acid), and a putative new catabolic pathway. Intramolecular transposition of insertion sequences followed by deletion was found to contribute to the diversity of some of these plasmids. The previous observation that the insertion sites of a Tn501-related element are identical in four IncP-1β plasmids (pJP4, pB10, R906, and R772) was further extended to three more IncP-1β plasmids (pAKD15, pAKD18, and pAKD29). 

Test for degradation of 2,4-D. The tfd gene-bearing plasmids pAKD25 and pAKD26 were tested for their ability to confer degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) to their bacterial hosts. 

Catabolic pathways encoded on four plasmids. Four of the 12 pAKD plasmids contain multiple catabolic genes, even though none was isolated from soil based on the ability to confer degradation of an organic compound. In line with several previously published IncP-1 plasmids (26, 38), at least three plasmids encode gene products known to be involved in the degradation of chlorinated aromatic compounds: (i) 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) degradation (tfd genes on pAKD25 and pAKD26), (ii) chlorocatechol degradation (mocp genes on pAKD26), (iii) dichlorophenoxypropionic acid (dichlorprop) degradation (sdpA and rdpA genes on pAKD34), and (iv) a possible novel pathway of unknown function on pAKD15.
The two plasmids that carry 2,4-D degradation (tfd) genes, pAKD25 and pAKD26, were isolated from the same agricultural soil and yet belong to different IncP-1 subgroups, IncP-1ε and IncP-1β, respectively (Fig. 1). 

Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. Complete nucleotide sequences of 12 pAKD plasmids have been submitted to GenBank, and their accession numbers are as follows: pAKD1 (JN106164), pAKD14 (JN106165), pAKD15 (JN106166), pAKD16 (JN106167), pAKD17 (JN106168), pAKD18 (JN106169), pAKD25 (JN106170), pAKD26 (JN106171), pAKD29 (JN106172), pAKD31 (JN106173), pAKD33 (JN106174), and pAKD34 (JN106175).

Comparative genomics of pAKD4, the prototype IncP-1delta plasmid with a complete backbone

Plasmid pAKD4 was previously isolated by exogenous plasmid isolation from an agricultural soil in Norway.

Moreover, since both pEST4011 and pIJB1 are missing a portion of their transfer genes, pAKD4 represents the first completely sequenced self-transferable plasmid with a complete IncP-1δ backbone. We therefore propose it to be the prototype IncP-1δ plasmid.

3.2. Comparative analysis of the backbone regions of pAKD4, pEST4011 and pIJB1

3.2.1. The replication initiation protein TrfA
An interesting feature of the IncP-1δ plasmids is the replication initiation gene trfA. In most IncP-1 plasmids known so far this gene has two in-frame translational start codons, and thus encodes a long TrfA1 and a shorter TrfA2 protein (also called TrfA-44 and TrfA-33 in IncP-1α plasmid RK2) [31]. Interestingly, since all three IncP-1δ plasmids are missing the 5′end of trfA, which encodes the start codon for and the N-terminal region (350 bp) of TrfA1, TrfA2 is the only replication initiation protein encoded by these plasmids. The 3′-end of the ssb gene, which is usually found upstream of trfA in most IncP-1 plasmids, is also missing in these plasmids. This gene codes for a single strand DNA-binding protein, which helps in DNA replication, recombination and repair. TrfA1 and Ssb proteins play a crucial role in plasmid replication in some bacterial hosts such as P. aeruginosa and may not be needed in some others such as P. putida and E. coli [32]. Therefore we postulate that IncP-1δ plasmids co-evolved with hosts that do not require TrfA1 and Ssb proteins and thereby contracted their host range. Further research is needed to test this hypothesis.

3.3. Transposable elements in pAKD4
In spite of the high similarity in plasmid backbone gene content, sequence and synteny between plasmid pAKD4 and plasmids pEST4011 and pIJB1, their accessory genes and the transposons that carry them are very different. Plasmids pEST4011 and pIJB1 both encode 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) on transposons and pIJB1 potentially also biphenyl degradation (Fig. 2). In contrast, plasmid pAKD4 does not encode 2,4-D or biphenyl degradation determinants. It is the smallest of the three IncP-1δ plasmids and has relatively few accessory genes (Fig. 2). These accessory genes are described below.

3.4. Evolutionary history of the IncP-1δ plasmids
Now that we have compared the backbones and accessory elements of the three IncP-1δ plasmids known so far, the putative evolutionary mechanisms that led to these three plasmids, and their effects on the plasmid phenotypes and ecology can be discussed. All three have been isolated from soils in Europe, and the only other indication of the presence of IncP-1δ plasmids is also from Europe (Denmark) [17]. Plasmid pAKD4 was isolated by a plasmid capture method from agricultural soil in Norway, and its host in that soil is not known [19], pEST4011 was found in a 2,4-D degrading strain, Achromobacter denitrificans EST4011, isolated from agricultural soil in Estonia [16], and pIJB1 was isolated from another 2,4-D degrading strain, Burkholderia cepacia 2a, from soil in Aberdeen, Scotland [21]. Future studies should determine the geographic distribution of these plasmids worldwide.

Transposons carrying tfd genes may have been acquired by pEST4011 and pIJB1 independently, since they are in reverse order in the two plasmids.

3.5. Plasmid host range
To confirm previous findings that plasmid pAKD4 can transfer and replicate in γ- and β-Proteobacteria, but not in α-Proteobacteria [19], the host range of pAKD4 was examined again. We showed transfer of pAKD4 from its laboratory host P. putida UWC1 (γ-Proteobacteria) to P. putida KT2442::gfp (γ-Proteobacteria), E. coli CV601::gfp (γ-Proteobacteria) and C. necator JMP228 (β-Proteobacteria), but transfer to Agrobacterium tumefaciens UBAPF2::gfp (α-Proteobacteria) could not be detected (data not shown). This is in agreement with previous results [19] and confirms that pAKD4 is a broad-host-range plasmid, albeit with a narrower host range than most other IncP-1 plasmids. Future rigorous host range studies will be needed to determine to what extent truncation of ssb and trfA in the IncP-1δ plasmids, or other missing backbone genes, caused a contraction of their host range, and if natural recombination events like the one that likely resulted in plasmid pIJB1, can reverse that host range contraction.

The completely sequenced plasmid pEST4011 contains a novel IncP1 backbone and a catabolic transposon harboring tfd genes for 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid degradation

We show that despite the overall similarity in plasmid organization, the pEST4011 backbone is sufficiently different (51 to 86% amino acid sequence identity between individual backbone genes) from the backbones of members of the three IncP1 subgroups (theα , β, and γ subgroups) that it belongs to a new IncP1subgroup, the δ subgroup. This conclusion was also supported by a phylogenetic analysis of the trfA2, korA, and traG gene products of different IncP1 plasmids.

The bootstrapped neighbor-joining trees derived from these alignments (obtained by using the program CLUSTALX) (Fig. ​(Fig.7)7) showed that pEST4011 TrfA, KorA, and TraG are distinct from all other corresponding sequences and that they occupy individual branches of each tree. Similar results were obtained with the different PHYLIP programs used (data not shown). As C. M. Thomas and coworkers have assigned plasmid pQKH54 (14) to the γ subgroup (personal communication) and the amino acid sequence of TrfA of pQKH54 appeared to be different from the pEST4011 TrfA sequence (unpublished data), we placed pEST4011 in a new IncP1 subgroup, the δ subgroup. The other four IncP1 catabolic plasmids sequenced, pJP4, pADP-1, pUO1, and pTSA, together with pIJB1, possess the well-conserved IncP1 subgroup β backbone. The TrfA2 phylogenetic tree (Fig. ​(Fig.7A)7A) shows that the 2,4-D-degradative plasmid pEMT3 is also different from all other IncP1 plasmids and could also form a separate subgroup. Unfortunately, the incompatibility group of the 2,4-D-degradative plasmid pTV1 is unknown (T. Vallaeys, personal communication).

Plasmid pEMT1 obtained in this study is a non-IncP1 plasmid that has catabolic genes that show high degrees of homology to the tfdABCDEFR/S pathways of the IncP1 plasmid pJP4.

Both IncP1 and non-IncP1 plasmids encoding 2,4-D degradation were present in the soil samples. The incompatibility group designation of several 2,4-D-degradative plasmids described in the literature is still unknown (5, 35).

Sequence and origin of the Streptomyces intergenetic-conjugation helper plasmid pUZ8002

In Streptomyces molecular genetics, the helper plasmid is generally pUZ8002, which is widely reported to be derived from the well-characterised broad-host-range RK2 plasmid [18]. RK2 is a IncP-type extra-chromosomal plasmid first identified during an outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella aerogenes from the Burns unit of the Birmingham Accident Hospital, UK, in 1969 [19]. RK2 carries genes for tetracycline and kanamycin resistance, genes for self-replication such as trfA, and genes necessary for conjugation, including the tra and trb locus. RK2 also has its own oriT, which allows self-conjugation and origin of replication for autonomous replication [20,22]. There are many plasmids in the IncP group and pUZ8 is another example, originally isolated from a Spanish strain of P. aeruginosa [23]. Unlike RK2, pUZ8 has not been fully sequenced, but is known to be similar to RK2, with both plasmids carrying tetracycline and kanamycin resistance genes [24].

Structure, function, and evolution of the Thiomonas spp. genome
Florence Arsène-Ploetze 1, 
https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000859
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2829063/

The plasmid, pTHI, contains 68 predicted CDS. 21 genes were found in synteny with genes carried by the R. eutropha JMP134 plasmid pJP4, and among them, par/trf/pem genes necessary for plasmid partitioning, stability and replication (Figure S1B). These observations suggest that pTHI, as JMP134, belongs to the IncP-1β group [28]. pTHI contains 13 of the 14 genes involved in conjugation (vir and tra genes) and genes that could fulfill the function of the missing components were found on the chromosome. Therefore, Thiomonas sp. 3As may be able to express a complete Type IV secretory system (T4SS) of the Vir/Tra type required for pTHI conjugal transfer. IncP-1β members are known to carry multi-resistance determinants and degradative cassettes [28], and plasmid pTHI indeed carries a Tn3-related transposon. This transposon contains part of a mercury resistance operon found in many other Gram negative bacterial transposon such as Tn21, Tn501 and Tn5053 [29].

The EMBL (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl) accession numbers for the genome of Thiomonas sp. 3As are FP475956 (chromosome) and FP475957 (plasmid).

Two ‘defence islands’ were identified in 78-ME genome: the first harbouring CRISPR-Cas with toxin-antitoxin system, while the second was composed by an array of genes for toxin-antitoxin and restriction-modification proteins. Among all identified spacers of CRISPR-Cas system only seven spacers match sequences of phages and plasmids. Furthermore, a conjugative plasmid p7ME01, which belongs to a new IncP-1θ ancestral archetype without any accessory mobile elements was found in 78-ME. 

Using approach of Norberg et al. (2011), we compared the concatenated backbone regions A, B and C of p7ME01 with corresponding regions of 23 IncP-1 plasmids retrieved from GenBank through BLAST and literature searches. As supported by phylogenetic analysis of the IncP-1 backbones, p7ME01 does belong to a novel clade, hereafter called θ (from the Greek word ‘θαλαθθα or thalassa’, meaning ‘sea’) (del Castillo et al., 2013). Additionally to p7ME01, this novel IncP-1θ clade currently consists of three other closely related plasmids (Fig. 4). Noteworthy, all of them were found in marine biofilm-forming gammaproteobacteria: Alcanivorax hongengensis A-11-3 (Lai and Shao, 2012b), Marinobacter adhaerens HP15 (Gärdes et al., 2010) and Methylophaga frappieri JAM7 (Auclair et al., 2010; Villeneuve et al., 2013).

Figure 4
Phylogenetic analysis showing the relationship of p7ME01 with other incP‐1 plasmids of the IncP‐1plasmid backbone. Maximum Likelihood tree was inferred from concatenated backbone regions A, B and C of 23 IncP‐1 plasmids belonging to all currently recognized clades (Norberg et al., 2011; del Castillo et al., 2013). Novel IncP‐1θ clade is shaded in grey. Five IncP‐1 plasmids without any accessory mobile elements known so far are highlighted in bold. Sequence of the uncharacterized plasmid MEALZ_p (FD082061) from Methylomicrobum alcaliphilum 20Z was used as an outgroup. The scale bar represents the probability of amino acid substitutions per site.

Two ‘defence islands’ were identified in its genome: one contained CRISPR-Cas and toxin-antitoxin system, while the second was composed of an array of genes for toxin-antitoxin and restriction-modification proteins. Among 116 spacers of CRISPR-Cas system only seven spacers matched phages and plasmids. Additionally, we showed that Cycloclasticus sp. 78-ME harbours a conjugative plasmid p7ME01 of a new IncP-1θ ancestral archetype, which likely suppresses the acquisition of exogenous DNA by this organism. Based on this finding, we suggested that the adaptive immunity of Cycloclasticus sp. 78-ME is linked with the acquisition of this plasmid.

The MOBQ family

From the first iteration, the family included a number of relaxases that also appeared in the BLAST search querying TraI_RP4 (the MOBP prototype), indicating that MOBQ and MOBP overlap. 

Figure 9

The members of this clade are related to MOBP, because they appeared in a BLAST using TraI_RP4 as a query. The intersection with MOBP only applied to the MOBQ1 clade. The rest of MOBQ relaxases have further evolved so that similarity with MOBP was not longer detected by PSI-BLAST when using the standard threshold. MOBQ1 relaxases are highly divergent; hence, some internal nodes of this subclade change in the ML topology.

The MOBP cluster
A PSI-BLAST search using TraI_RP4 as a query and a score threshold P<10−4 converged after 14 iterations and retrieved 259 relaxase sequences (Tables S4–S6).

Phylogeny tree of MOBP1 relaxases. Codes for underlines, asterisks, boxes, gene synteny and vertical bars are the same as in Fig. 2. Azosp, Azoarcus sp. EbN1; Niteu, Nitrosomonas eutropha; Desps=Desulfotalea psychrophila; Nitmu=Nitrosospira multiformis.

Clade MOBP11 is composed exclusively of conjugative plasmids and has RP4 (IncP1α) and R751 (IncP1β) as prototypes. In fact, the IncP cluster (Heuer et al., 2004; Haines et al., 2006b; Bahl et al., 2007) is broad, and includes probably all plasmids listed in Fig. 12 from RP4 down to ‘plasmid 59 kb’. Thus, the IncP group is a deep, well-populated clade that contains a large number of conjugative plasmids. We propose to call it MOBP111. Because this is probably the most thoroughly analysed plasmid incompatibility group, it serves to underline the spread we can expect of an Inc group when it is analysed exhaustively. Although many other Inc groups are only represented by a single member in this work, each Inc group might be expected to encompass a clade that can reach the extension of IncP or IncF groups.


The conserved motifs in MOBP1 are shown in Fig. 13. As can be seen, MOBP1 relaxases share the classical motifs of MOBF and MOBQ relaxases. The most conspicuous is the 3H motif, which shows the signature H-x-(DE)-T-(DE)-x2-H-x-H-x3-N-x3-P. The argument about the acidic residue in motif II, which was invoked in section The MOBQ family, continues here because MOBP1 relaxases also contain a conserved D/E (E80 in TraI_RP4, signalled by a white arrowhead in Fig. 13) that could play the same role as D85 in TrwC_R388. Site-directed mutagenesis of TraI_RP4 (Pansegrau et al., 1994) defined the three sequence motifs in MOBP relaxases and identified one essential residue in each motif (Y22, S74 and H116). E80 was not tested and, surprisingly, H109 or H118 showed to be nonessential (Fig. 13).

Figure 13

Conserved sequence motifs in the MOBP1 subclades. Vertical black arrowheads and black circles point to residues configuring the catalytic centre. Mutations in TraI_RP4 affecting those residues either affected conjugation (black arrowheads) or did not (black circles). The vertical white arrowhead points to E79 in TraI_RP4, another potential key residue (see The MOBP cluster). *The N-terminal sequences of these relaxases were wrongly annotated (by comparison with homologous relaxases). Visual inspection allowed us to realize that if the annotated CDSs were extended upstream (pRAS3: −57 codons; pTF-FC2: −41 codons; pPNAP06: −13 codons), motif I was found. Azosp, Azoarcus sp.

Multiple gene‐shuffling events are apparent, including mobilized and replicated transposition, as well as plasmid or phage integration events into the 2.66 Mbp chromosome and two plasmids (65 and 56 kbp) of N. eutropha C91. A 117 kbp genomic island encodes multiple genes for heavy metal resistance, including clusters for copper and mercury transport, which are absent from the genomes of other ammonia‐oxidizing bacteria (AOB). 

The N. eutropha C91 genome is composed of a single circular chromosome (2 661 057 bp, 48.5% G + C content) and two large plasmids, pNeutP1 (65 132 bp, 49.8% G + C) and pNeutP2 (55 635 bp, 49.7% G + C) (Table 1). The two plasmids each contain an identical 11 414 bp (56.1% G + C) transposon (Tn_Neut) flanked by short inverted repeats (Table 2).

The chromosome and the 65 and 56 kbp plasmids of N. eutropha (pNeutP1 and pNeutP2, respectively) can be found in the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ database under accession numbers CP000450, CP000451 and CP000452 respectively.

The mobile genome pool includes two novel plasmids phylogenetically unrelated to all currently reported Yersinia plasmids.

General Genome Features
The genome of Y. pseudotuberculosis IP31758 consists of a circular chromosome of 4,723,306 bp (Figure 1A) and two novel plasmids called pYpsIP31758.1 (153,140 bp; Figure 1B) and pYpsIP31758.2 (58,679 bp; Figure 1C).

pYpsIP31758.1 appears to lack a complete plasmid transfer system; however, such a system is present on the smaller plasmid pYpsIP31758.2 (Figure 1C). The pYpsIP31758.2 transfer system is most similar to that of the Pseudomonas species IncP-1beta group pB3 plasmids [94,95], and may also provide the transfer function for the large plasmid. pYpsIP31758.2 is replicated and maintained through a kil/kor system. Such a mechanism has not previously been reported in Yersinia, nor has the incompatibility surface exclusion protein also found on pYpsIP31758.2 (YpsIP31758_A0016) [96,97].

Conjugative plasmids of Neisseria gonorrhoeae

Many clinical isolates of the human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae contain conjugative plasmids. The host range of these plasmids is limited to Neisseria species, 
Analysis of the backbone sequences showed that they belong to a novel IncP1 subfamily divergent from the IncP1α, β, γ, δ and ε subfamilies. 
The presence of the toxin and antitoxin on different plasmids might explain why the host range of this IncP1 plasmid is limited to Neisseria species. 

Results

Complete sequencing of the plasmid (pEP5289) resulted in a sequence of 42.004 bp. 

Figure 1
Circular map of the Neisserial conjugative plasmid (pEP5289) with the Dutch type tetM determinant and a Dutch type backbone.

The conjugative plasmids with the Dutch type backbone are phylogenetically divergent from the other IncP1 sub-families
The modular arrangement of the conjugative plasmid and derivates thereof, the absence of several genes often found in the IncP1-α subfamily, and an insertion of an additional module suggested that these plasmids are members of the IncP1-β sub-family. To verify placement of the plasmids in the IncP1-β sub-family, a phylogenetic analysis was performed on the TraI and TraG proteins encoded in the Tra region, the TrbE and TrbC proteins encoded in the Trb region, and the TrfA and KorB proteins encoded within the Rep and Ctl regions. Neighbor-joining tree containing representative members of the different IncP1 plasmid subfamilies (α, RP4; β, pADP-1; γ, QKH54; δ, pEST4011 and ε, pKJK5) and the neisserial conjugative plasmids with the Dutch type backbone were created (See figure 3). Remarkably this showed that these neisserial conjugative plasmids fall within the IncP1 family, but are phylogenetically divergent from the other IncP1 sub-families, and are members of a new subfamily.

Figure 3
Phylogenetic analysis of genes of different IncP1 plasmids.
The TraI (A), TrbE (B), TraG (C) and TrfA (D) proteins of the neisserial conjugative plasmids and of representative members of different IncP1 plasmid subfamilies (α, RP4; β, pADP-1; γ, QKH54; δ, pEST4011 and ε, pKJK5) representative for different regions of the conjugative plasmids were used to create phylogenetic trees of the IncP1 plasmid family. (For details see materials and methods).

Author Notes
The GenBank accession numbers for the complete whole-genome sequence are CP038018 (chromosome) and CP038019 (plasmid). The GenBank accession number for the for the full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence is MK541038.

Strain PXXT also contained a single 39 819 bp plasmid encoding 19 genes. Except for genes related to the conjugation system and a toxin–antitoxin system, only hypothetical proteins were found on the plasmid. The plasmid was not found in E. exigua strain EI-02, but a homologous gen-segment was detected in two GenBank whole-genome projects, one in the E. exigua cluster (NML01-A-08, 98.9 % homology) and the other probably representing an undescribed Eikenella species (NML130454, 94.8 % homology). The plasmid was not found in any of the study E. corrodens isolates nor in any E. corrodens GenBank whole-genome projects.

Rapid Increase in the IS 26-Mediated cfr Gene in E. coli Isolates with IncP and IncX4 Plasmids and Co-Existing cfr and mcr-1 Genes in a Swine Farm
Zhenbao Ma 1 2 3, Jiao Liu 1 2 3, Lin Chen 1 2 3, Xiaoqin Liu 1 2 3, Wenguang Xiong 1 2 3, Jian-Hua Liu 1 2 3, Zhenling Zeng 1 2 3

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7823714/
Sequence analysis suggested that the plasmids pHNEP124 and pHNEP129 co-harboring the cfr and mcr-1 genes belonged to the plasmids IncP plasmid and IncX4 plasmid, respectively.

2.5. Plasmid Analysis of pHNEP124
The sequence analysis revealed that plasmid pHNEP124 is 60430 base pairs (bp) in size with an average GC content of 47.01% and belonged to plasmid pMCR_1511-like IncP type plasmid, which consisted of a typical plasmid backbone and two mosaic variant regions. The backbone of plasmid pHNEP124 is comprised of the trfA encoding plasmid replication initiation protein, two par modules for plasmid partitioning, a toxin-antitoxin higA-B system, and a “KlcA-kleE” region encoding a host-lethal protein for plasmid maintenance and stability, as well as the two conjugative regions tra (~17.3-kb) and trb (~12.7-kb) for plasmid horizontal transfer. BLASTn analysis indicated that the backbone of the plasmid pHNEP124 shared a high identity (>99%) with those mcr-1-carrying IncP type plasmids found in Enterobacteriaceae, such as E. coli plasmid pHNGDF36-1 (Genbank accession no. MF978389), Klebsiella pneumoniae pMCR_1511 (Genbank accession no. KX377410), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium pMCR16_P053 (Genbank accession no. KY352406), and Citrobacter braakii pSCC4 (Genbank accession no. CP021078), which are obtained from diverse sources such as fish products, hospital sewage, chickens, and humans. Moreover, it also showed high homology (>99%) to IncP plasmid pHNFP671 (Genbank accession no. KP324830) which carries the cfr gene and was isolated from swine feces in Guangdong Province, China. A comparative analysis of the plasmid pHNEP124 and other IncP plasmids indicated that IncP type plasmids have a conserved backbone structure, except plasmid pSCC4, which is missing an ~8.4 kb conjugative region (Figure 3A). In addition, plasmid pHNFP671, with ~35.5-kb insertion, contained a conjugative region and a cfr-carrying module (Figure 3A).

The Genetic Context of mcr-1.1 on pQDFD216.1
The mcr-1.1 was located on pQDFD216.1 which was 33,308 bp in length and had an average GC content of 41.83%. PlasmidFinder analysis indicated that pQDFD216.1 belonged to the IncX4 incompatibility group (Table S2).

The Genetic Contexts of mcr-3.7 on pQDFD216.2
The mcr-3.7-bearing plasmid pQDFD216.2 was 50,638 bp in size and had a GC content of 47.08%. PlasmidFinder analysis revealed that pQDFD216.2 belonged to the IncP1 type plasmid (Table S2). The IncP1 plasmids have a broad host range and are widespread in Gram-negative organisms, including E. coli, K. pneumonia and S. enteric.34–36 The association of mcr-3.7 with the IncP plasmid is worrisome because it may have the potential to promote the dissemination of mcr-3 in Gram-negative pathogens.

The plasmid pQDFD216.2 did not carry any other resistance gene besides mcr-3.7. The pQDFD216.2 plasmid has the conjugative transfer/type IV secretion system (tra and trb), replication initiator (trfA), replication and partition genes (parA and parB), toxin-antitoxin genes (higA-higB), host-lethal genes (klc) and their regulators (kor) (Figures 1B and ​and2B).2B). BLASTn analysis showed that plasmids pMCR3_WCHEC1943 (GenBank accession: MF678351.1), pGDZJ003-1-MCR-3 (GenBank accession: MH043625.1), pMCR3_WCHEC-LL123 (GenBank accession: MF489760.1), pZR12 (GenBank accession: MF455227.1) and pMCR_WCHEC1622 (GenBank accession: KY463452.1) were most similar to pQDFD216.2 (Figure 1B). These plasmids showed 99.96–99.98% nucleotide sequence identity with pQDFD216.2. The mcr-3.7 gene was located in pQDFD216.2 with the structure TnAs2-mcr-3.7-dgkA-IS26, which was also found in the mcr-3.7-carrying IncP1 plasmids pMCR3_WCHEC-LL123 and pGDZJ003-1-MCR-3 (Figure 2B). However, unlike pQDFD216.2, pGDZJ003-1-MCR-3 partially lacked the conjugal transfer gene TraC of the IncP-type plasmid (Figure 2B). Furthermore, when compared with pMCR3_WCHEC-LL123, the mobile genetic element IS1294 was absent in pQDFD216.2 (Figure 2B).

3.2. Comparative Genomics of mcr-3-Harboring Plasmids
We succeeded in sequencing of MCR-3-producing plasmids pGDZJ002-1, pGDZJ003–2 and pGDZJ004 from GDZJ002, GDZJ003 and GDZJ004, respectively, and mcr-1-encoding plasmid pGDZJ003-1 from the GDZJ003. Of the two plasmids isolated from GDZJ003, whole genome sequencing shows that plasmid pGDZJ003–2 is a 50,537 kb plasmid that contains 73 ORFs including the mcr-3.7 gene. MCR-3.7 has 18 amino acid substitutions when compared to MCR-3. This IncP-type plasmid is also seen to possess the tra and trb conjugative regions, portioning modules par, replication initiator trfA, host-lethal protein encoding genes klc and their regulators kor and a toxin-antitoxin system higA-B (Fig. 2B). It shows very high sequence identity to another IncP-type mcr-3.7-bearing plasmid pMCR3_WCHEC-LL123 [54] (Accession no.: MF489760) isolated from human isolates of E. coli. However, unlike pMCR3_WCHEC-LL123, pGDZJ003–2 is missing the insertion sequence IS1294 (Fig. 2C) and does not have additional antibiotic resistance genes like blaTEM (conferring ampicillin resistance). When compared to another IncP type mcr-1-carrying plasmid, pMCR_1511 [93], pGDZJ003–2 also lacks the transposition unit of mcr-1 (ISApl1-mcr-1-hp) on pMCR_1511 (Fig. 2D). The other plasmid from GDZJ003 is pGDZJ003-1 which harbors the mcr-1 gene and is 33,522 kb in length with a GC content of 42%. This plasmid contains 43 predicted ORFs, with 17 associated with formation of the type IV pilus (Fig. 2A). Comparative analysis shows that its backbone is very closely related to two narrow-host-range IncX4-type plasmids [94] pSH146-32 (Accession no.: JX258655) and the mcr-1-harboring plasmid pCSZ4 [95] (Accession no.: KX711706) (Fig. 2C). Like most IncX4 plasmids, both pCSZ4 and pGDZJ003–1 are missing the ISApl1 insertion sequence in front of the mcr-1 gene.

D. Linear genome alignment of the mcr-3-positive plasmid pGDZJ003_mcr-3.7 with the other two plasmids (pMCR3_WCHEC-LL123 and pMCR_1511).

Similarly, genome sequences for two other mcr-3-carrying plasmids, pGDZJ002-1 (50,818 kb; Fig. S2) and pGDZJ004 (50,519 kb; Fig. S3) were obtained. Both plasmids have a GC content of 47% and contain similar elements for replication, conjugation, and partitioning (Figs S2 and S3). Colinear genome analysis of pGDZJ003–2 and pMCR3_WCHEC-LL123 shows that they possess similar genetic arrangements (Fig. S4) and belong to the IncP family of plasmids. 

2.7. Sequence Data
GenBank accession numbers of new plasmids with full genome sequences are listed as follow: MH043623 for pGDZJ002–1; MH043624 for pGDZJ003–1; MH043625 for pGDZJ003–2; and MH043626 for pGDZJ004.

A colistin-resistant Escherichia coli isolate from a commercial poultry farm in China carried two colistin resistance genes, mcr-1 and variant of mcr-3, in an IncP plasmid.

The variant of mcr-3 and the mcr-1 gene were colocated in a conjugative 60.7-kb IncP plasmid, designated pECSC102. It had a length of 60,744 bp, with 47.2% G+C content (Fig. S2). Plasmid pECSC102 aligned very well to two mcr-carrying IncP plasmids, pMCR3_WCHEC-LL123 (GenBank accession no. MF489760), found in an E. coli isolate, and pMCR_1511 (GenBank accession no. KX377410), found in a K. pneumoniae isolate (Fig. 1).

In WCHEC1622, mcr-1.1 was carried by a 49,897-bp IncP plasmid, designated pMCR_WCHEC1622, which was almost identical (100% coverage and 99% identity) to pMCR_1511 (Figure ​Figure44), an IncP plasmid recovered from K. pneumoniae in the same sewage sample (Zhao et al., 2017). Like pMCR_1511, pMCR_WCHEC1622 belongs to a new clade of IncP (Zhao et al., 2017). As IncP plasmids are broad-host-range, the carriage of mcr-1 on IncP plasmids has the potential to mediate the dissemination of mcr-1 from the Enterobacteriaceae to other bacterial species.

IncP Plasmid Carrying Colistin Resistance Gene mcr-1 in Klebsiella pneumoniae from Hospital Sewage

The backbone of pMCR_1511 was highly similar (99% identity) to that of plasmid pHNFP671 (GenBank accession number KP324830), which was an IncP plasmid in E. coli isolate FP671 from Guangzhou, China but did not carry mcr-1. IncP-1 plasmid has six assigned clades, i.e., α, β, γ, δ, ε, and ζ, among which β clade has two subclades (β1 and β2) (24). To determine which clade pMCR_1511 belonged to, the sequences of 30 genes belonging to the IncP-1 backbone were retrieved from pMCR_1511, were concatenated and were then aligned to the counterparts of one representative plasmid of each clade, including the β1 and β2 subclades, as described previously (25). Phylogenetic analysis of the IncP-1 plasmid backbone revealed that pMCR_1511 and pHNFP671 belonged to a new IncP-1 clade (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).

FIG 1
Genetic structure of IncP plasmid pMCR_1511 carrying mcr-1 and comparison with IncP plasmid pHNFP671.

It is known that ISApl1 generates 2-bp direct target repeats (DR) upon insertion (26) (https://www-is.biotoul.fr/scripts/ficheIS.php?name=ISApl1). The 2-bp flanking sequences of the region bracketed by the two copies of ISApl1 were identical (AC) (Fig. 2).

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5278755/figure/F2/
FIG 2
Genetic context of mcr-1 on pMCR_1511. 

The ISApl1 downstream of mcr-1 on pMCR_1511 was interrupted by the insertion of Tn3 with the characteristic 5-bp DR (Fig. 2). The Tn3 was also disrupted by IS26 and most of the Tn3 was absent, which may result from the action of IS26. It is well known that the insertion of IS26 can lead to the deletion of the adjacent sequence of the insertion site (28). Alternatively, the insertion of the second IS26 and the recombination between the two copies of IS26 might eliminate the intervening region, resulting in the loss of most of Tn3. Although Tn3 interrupted the ISApl1 downstream of mcr-1, the right-end inverted repeat (IRR) of ISApl1 remained intact (Fig. 2). The transposase encoded by the ISApl1 upstream of mcr-1 had the potential to recognize the IRR of the downstream ISApl1 and thus mobilize the region bracketed by the two copies of ISApl1.

Sequencing reads and the whole-genome shotgun sequencing project of K. pneumoniae strain WCHKP1511 have been deposited into DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under accession numbers SRR3170679 and LSMF00000000, respectively. The sequence of pMCR_1511 has been deposited into DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under accession number KX377410.

First report of a clinical, multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolate coharboring fosfomycin resistance gene fosA3 and carbapenemase gene blaKPC-2 on the same transposon, Tn1721

The complete sequence of pHS102707 showed that this plasmid belongs to the P11 subfamily (IncP1) and has a replication gene, several plasmid-stable genes, an intact type IV secretion system gene cluster, and a composite transposon Tn1721-Tn3 that harbored blaKPC-2. Interestingly, a composite IS26 transposon carrying fosA3 was inserted in the Tn1721-tnpA gene in pHS102707 and pHS112625, leading to the disruption of Tn1721-tnpA and the deletion of Tn1721-tnpR. However, only IS26 with a truncated Tn21-tnpR was inserted in pHS092839 at the same position. To our knowledge, this is the first report of fosA3 and blaKPC-2 colocated in the same Tn1721-Tn3–like composite transposon on a novel IncP group plasmid.

FIG 2
(a) Schematic map of pHS102707, an IncP plasmid found in the carbapenem-resistant E. coli isolate investigated in this study. 
(b) Inferred phylogenetic relationships of the plasmid-coding relaxase homologs. Seventeen protein sequences were aligned and the tree was generated with MEGA5 (21, 22) using the maximum-likelihood method. The relaxase sequences obtained in this study are indicated by blank arrows, while others were taken from Alvarado et al. (25). The sequences marked by an asterisk denote the ones taken from the prototype plasmid of each subfamily.

Within each family, subfamilies corresponding to phylogenetic clades contain more members (e.g., MOBF12, which harbors relaxases encoded by IncF plasmids, and MOBP11, which groups relaxases encoded by IncP plasmids) (23). Phylogenetic analysis shows that the three relaxases encoded by pHS102707, pHS092839, and pHS112625 were grouped as the P11 relaxase subfamily (Fig. 2b). Relaxase protein sequence comparison of pHS102707 revealed 30.5% identity with RP4 (Inc P1α), the prototype plasmid for the P11 subfamily. The relaxase most similar to that of pHS102707, pXFAS01, exhibited 47% identity; no identity was found with any other non-P11 subfamily relaxases by NCBI blast.

The blaKPC-2 and fosA3 genes are borne on a novel mosaic transposon.

pKP048 belongs to the F family (IncF), while pHS102707, pHS092839, and pHS112625 belong to the P11 subfamily (IncP1). This suggests that a block mobilization of the complex transposon may happen among IncP1 plasmids. Interestingly, EcoRI and HindIII digestion profiles (Fig. 1c) show that the three P11 subfamily plasmids are not identical, and some differences exist.

ABSTRACT

The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the composition of this unique domain is typical within the described TrfA-like protein family.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Phylogenetic analysis and determination of sequence divergence
Protein sequences of the Rep; TrfA; Orc1, 2, 3, 4, 5; and Cdc6 families were obtained from the Pfam database, version 31.0 (28). Sequences were aligned separately using Clustal Omega v1.2.2 with default parameters (29). The alignment was corrected manually. 


12 Orc, 16 Rep and 8 TrfA sequences were chosen for phylogenetic analysis based on sequence divergence and literature data. One thousand ML searches were performed using RAxML v.8.2.10 (32) with 100 rapid bootstrap replicates under the LG model of amino acid substitution and GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity with four discrete rate categories and the estimates proportion of invariable sites (LG + I + G) (33), which was determined to be the best-fit model for all families by ProtTest v3.2 following the Akaike criterion (34).

RESULTS

Interestingly, in some Rep proteins, we identified a short hydrophobic region located before the WH1 domain. This region shares a degree of similarity with a sequence within the N-terminal TrfA region (Figure 1). We thus asked how the TrfA-like proteins are related to other replication initiators. To answer this question, we performed phylogenetic analysis of the representative DNA replication initiators using the maximum likelihood method (ML) (Supplementary Figure S1). Our ML analysis of the WH domains revealed a close monophyletic relationship among all TrfA-like proteins containing extended N-termini. Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis indicated that the TrfA-like proteins are most closely related to RepC, an IncQ-type replication protein C (51,52), and belong to a common protein family together with other plasmid replication initiation factors (Supplementary Figures S1, S2).

Additional N-ter domains (such as the domain I of RctB) have been found in TrfA-like plasmid initiators (DBD) (43). The role of domain I in RctB is still elusive. Additional C-terminal domains (such as the domain IV of RctB) have not found in iteron-like plasmid initiators. RctB domain IV is crucial for coordinating Chr1 and Chr2 replication. Representation adapted from (43).

Recently, a unique third domain was identified in TrfA, the Rep initiator of the broad host range RK2 iteron-plasmids. The third domain of TrfA is essential for replication and has led to the definition of a new class of TrfA-like initiators containing three DNA-interacting domains, WH1, WH2 and DBD (43).

Plasmid pAcX50c

It appears that pACX50c most closely matches plasmids isolated from Pseudomonas species amongst the γ-proteobacteria including pQKH54 [108]. In our earlier work pACX50c was apparently cured when the IncP-1 plasmid RP4 was introduced and stably maintained in the strain by selecting for the antibiotic resistance it encodes [40]. This would appear to provide further evidence that pACX50c belongs to the IncP-1 incompatibility group. 

One of the plasmids in Ac-8003, pAcX50c, belongs to the IncP-1 incompatability group and the genomic analysis shows it contains tra and trb gene clusters found in the IncP1-γ family of plasmids from Pseudomonads.


The sequences of the chromosome and 6 plasmids have been deposited with Genbank under the accession numbers as follows: chromosome, CP010415; pAcX50a, CP010416; pAcX50b, CP010417; pAcX50c, CP010418; pAcX50d, CP010419; pAcX50e, CP010420; pAcX50f, CP010421.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Host range assays.
The host range of the marked plasmids was evaluated by conjugative transfer to three bacterial strains: Pseudomonas putida UCW1gfp, Cupriavidus pinatubonensis JMP228gfp, and Sinorhizobium meliloti RM1021, belonging to the Gamma-, Beta-, and Alphaproteobacteria, respectively (36). 

Phylogenetic analysis of IncP-1 plasmids.
The part of the trfA gene that is conserved among the IncP-1 plasmids was used to infer the phylogenetic relationship of pDS1 with the other IncP-1 subgroups. 

RESULTS

Capture of plasmids from freshwater sources.

Except for pDS1 and pDS2, all plasmids showed a broad host range as they transferred and replicated in alpha-, beta-, and gammaproteobacteria (Table 2).


Table 2
General features of completely sequenced plasmids
dPlasmids pDS1 and pDS2 were transferable into E. coli but could not be transferred to P. putida, C. pinatubonensis, or S. meliloti.


A phylogeny inferred from the trfA gene showed that pDS1 is distinct from other known subgroups including the new IncP-1ζ plasmids isolated from marine biofilms (57) (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, unlike most other IncP-1 plasmids, pDS1 could not be transferred to P. putida or C. pinatubonensis (Table 2). To verify the placement of pDS1 in the IncP-1 group, an incompatibility assay was performed. The marked plasmid pDS1T was introduced into E. coli DH10B(pQKH54) by conjugation, and loss of pQKH54 was monitored when we selected for the incoming plasmid only. Nearly 80% of the clones tested had lost pQKH54 by day 1, in contrast to only a 16% loss of pQKH54 in a separate stability assay. This indicates that pDS1T is incompatible with IncP-1 plasmids and can be classified as an IncP-1 plasmid. We therefore propose the new subgroup IncP-1η for pDS1.

Fig 4
Phylogenetic relationship of pDS1 to other IncP-1 plasmid subgroups. The conserved 3′ end of the trfA gene was used to infer the phylogeny of 45 IncP-1 plasmids using the maximum-likelihood method (base frequencies, gamma shape parameter, proportion of invariant sites, and rate matrix [a b c c b a] were estimated from the data). The incompatibility subgroup of each clade is indicated on the right.

DISCUSSION

The narrow host range of the IncP-1η plasmid pDS1 was unexpected, given that most IncP-1-like plasmids have a broad host range. A preliminary plasmid genomic signature analysis suggested a signature that is quite different from the other IncP-1 plasmids captured in this study (H. Suzuki, personal communication). As pDS1 transferred very well between E. coli strains, the plasmid's transfer system seems intact. Since the molecular basis of the apparent narrow host range of this IncP-1η plasmid is of great interest, a detailed host range investigation will be the subject of a future study, combining experimental host range testing with a plasmid genomic signature analysis to assess its potential host range (81).

These plasmids demonstrate great diversity – a phylogenetic study has shown the presence of 45 backbone genes on IncP-1 plasmids, but only 33 are shared by all the plasmids that have been completely sequenced to date.

A detailed phylogenetic analysis and study of the amino acid sequence of protein TrfA, which initiates plasmid replication, have allowed the classification of group IncP-1 into six subgroups: -α, -β, -γ, -ε, -δ (Bahl, 2009), and -ζ (Norberg et al., 2011) and also into an unnamed subgroup (Pachulec and van der Does, 2010). Unpublished data also indicate the existence of a η subgroup (Sen et al., 2012). IncP-1 plasmids have been identified in clinical and environmental, phylogenetically very distant, host bacterial species from around the world.

Abstract
The IncP-1ε plasmids can be clearly subdivided into two subclades, designated as ε-I and ε-II, based on phylogenetic analysis of backbone proteins TraI and TrfA. 


INTRODUCTION

Four IncP-1ε plasmids carried catabolic pathway genes responsible for herbicide degradation, with plasmids pAKD25, p712 and pEMT3 being associated with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid degradation, and pAKD34 carrying putative 2,4-dichlorophenoxypropionic acid-degrading genes (Top, Holben and Forney 1995; Sen et al. 2011; Kim et al. 2013).

The partial genome sequences of these plasmids were determined by Illumina sequencing, and the backbone regions were completely assembled.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4809973/#sec2title

Host range test
To determine the host range of captured plasmids, the plasmids were transferred from E. coli EC100 (γ-Proteobacteria, SmR) to Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 (α-Proteobacteria, RifR) (Wood et al. 2001) and Cupriavidus necator JMP228 (β-Proteobacteria, RifR) (Top, Holben and Forney 1995) by biparental matings as described previously (Binh et al. 2008).

Sequencing and annotation

The backbone genes of four plasmids (pSFS12, pSFS26, pSFS52 and pSFW53) were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KM655308 to KM655311.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=KM655308:KM655311[pacc]

Bioinformatic analysis and software

RESULTS
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4809973/#sec3title

To determine the host range of the four plasmids, we tested their ability to transfer from the γ-Proteobacterium E. coli and replicate in A. tumefaciens C58 and C. necator JMP228, members of the α- and β-Proteobacteria, respectively. These host range tests indicated that the four plasmids were self-transferrable and could replicate in the tested strains of α-, β- and γ-Proteobacteria.

Although the sequences of these four plasmids were not completely closed, the fully assembled backbone regions enabled us to infer the insertion sites of the partially sequenced accessory elements (Fig. 1 and Fig. S2, Supporting Information).

Construction of gfpmut3-tagged plasmid pKJK5
Plasmids RP4 and pIPO2tet have been constructed earlier (Musovic et al., 2010, 2014). The 54 kbp IncP-1 plasmid, pKJK5, originally isolated from a soil/manure environment, harbors a tetracycline and a trimethoprim resistance determinant, and a class 1 integron (Sengeløv et al., 2001). 

Figure 4
Phylogenetic tree showing all identified transconjugant OTUs for three different plasmids (pKJK5, RP4 and pIPO2tet) from the same donor (P. putida). 

The core super-permissive community consists mainly of diverse Proteobacteria such as Enterobacteriales (γ), Burkholderiales (β), Pseudomonadales (γ) and Rhizobiales (α) (Figure 4). 

These species are mainly found within Enterobacteriales (Gammaproteobacteria), Burkholderiales (Betaproteobacteria) and Staphylococci (Bacilli), groups that contain most of our super-permissive OTUs.

The multiple antibiotic resistance IncP-1 plasmid pKJK5 isolated from a soil environment is phylogenetically divergent from members of the previously established alpha, beta and delta sub-groups
Martin Iain Bahl 1, Lars Hestbjerg Hansen, Alexander Goesmann, Søren J Sørensen
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0147619X06001168?via%3Dihub
The 54,383bp plasmid pKJK5 was recovered from a soil environment by exogenous plasmid isolation and conveys resistance towards tetracycline and trimethoprim. Sequencing and annotation revealed a high level of structural similarity of the backbone genes to other IncP-1 plasmids containing a Tra1 and Tra2 region, a central control module and a replication initiation module. 

Individual backbone genes in pKJK5 have a GC-content, which is consistently lower (average 6.3%) than the homologous genes from the archetype IncP-1β plasmid R751 indicating homogenous amelioration of IncP-1 plasmid backbone genes. 

Load 1 consists of an insertion sequence ISPa17 and load 2 is a Tn402-derivative containing a class 1 integron, IS1326 and a fragment identical to a region of plasmid pTB11 harboring a tetracycline resistance determinant and part of an IncP-1α oriV region.


2. Materials and methods

2.3. Phenotypic characterization of plasmid pKJK5 and plasmid DNA isolation

Furthermore the ability of pKJK5 to transfer within and between different sub-divisions of proteobacteria was tested using donor E. coli CSH26 (γ-proteobacteria) and recipients Pseudomonas putida (γ-proteobacteria) and Ochrobactrum sp. (α-proteobacteria), respectively, by a slightly modified standard 24 h filter mating procedure (Sengeløv et al., 2001). 

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Multiple antibiotic resistance and a broad host range is associated with plasmid pKJK5

The ability of pKJK5 to be transferred to and stably maintained in the same and other sub-divisions of proteobacteria was exemplified by P. putida and Ochrobactrum sp., which belong to the gamma and alpha subdivision respectively. Thus pKJK5 is defined as a broad-host-range plasmid (Szpirer et al., 1999). A more extensive analysis of the natural host-range of pKJK5 will be published elsewhere.

3.2.1. 

One such mechanism could be to gradually adjust the GC-content of the plasmid to better suit the host cell.

3.5. The GC-content of the individual backbone genes in pKJK5 is lower than that of the homologous genes in prototype IncP-1β plasmid R751, which indicates a homogeneous amelioration of IncP-1 plasmids across their entire backbone sequence

Fig. 4. Comparison between the mol% of GC in all backbone genes of plasmid R751 (black line) and pKJK5 (gray line). The percentage of GC-content increases from the centre (50% GC-content) towards the outer perimeter (75% GC-content) of the circular plot.

RESULTS

Plasmid host range

DNA sequencing and the IncP-1 backbone of pQKH54

The G+C content of the backbone is generally lower than for the other subgroups.

DISCUSSION

While pQKH54 clearly belongs to the IncP-1 family it is distinct from IncP-1β plasmids and appears to be somewhat less broad host range than pQKH6 and pQM719. This would also be consistent with the lower G+C content of the genome since it suggests adaptation to a different group of hosts.

The three IncP-1α plasmids pB5, pB11 and pSP21 were isolated from bacteria of two different sewage treatment plants and sequenced by a combination of next-generation and capillary sequencing technologies. A comparative analysis including the previously analysed IncP-1α plasmids RK2, pTB11 and pBS228 revealed a highly conserved plasmid backbone (at least 99.9% DNA sequence identity) comprising 54 core genes. The accessory elements of the plasmid pB5 constitute a class 1 integron interrupting the parC gene and an IS6100 copy inserted into the integron. In addition, the tetracycline resistance genes tetAR and the ISTB11-like element are located between the klc operon and the trfA–ssb operon.

The annotated nucleotide sequences of the plasmids pB5, pB11 and pSP21 were submitted to the EMBL database (pB5 – GenBank accession no. CP002151; pB11 – GenBank accession no. CP002152; pSP21 – GenBank accession no. CP002153).

The IncP alpha promiscuous plasmid (R18, R68, RK2, RP1 and RP4) comprises 60,099 bp of nucleotide sequence, encoding at least 74 genes. 
The most frequently used initiation codon is AUG but translation for a few open reading frames begins at GUG or UUG. The most common stop-codon is UGA followed by UAA and then UAG.

The trfA and trfB promoter regions of broad host range plasmid RK2 share common potential regulatory sequences
C A Smith, V Shingler, C M Thomas
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC318773/
The positions of the trfA and trfB promoters of broad host range IncP plasmid RK2 (identical to RP1, RP4, R68 and R18 ) were identified by RNA polymerase protection studies, and the nucleotide sequences of the promoter regions determined. A mutation within the trfA promoter sequence is associated with loss of kilD activity. In addition a probable promoter region for the kilB locus was identified. The three promoter regions share common palindromic sequences which may serve as sites for the coordinate regulation of replication and kil functions.

Escherichia coli ST18 and MFDpir are donors commonly used to transfer oriTRP4-containing plasmids to diverse bacteria via conjugation. 

ANNOUNCEMENT
A common laboratory method for transferring plasmids to diverse bacteria is via conjugation from an Escherichia coli donor strain. Several E. coli K-12 derivative strains have been engineered as donors, typically based on mobilization machinery derived from the broad-host-range plasmid RP4 (1,–4). To facilitate efficient postmating donor counterselection, several auxotrophic E. coli donors, such as ST18, have been constructed (5). ST18 is a 5-aminolevulinic acid auxotroph derivative of S17-1 λpir that was derived by deletion of hemA (5,–8). 

The complete genome sequences have been deposited in NCBI GenBank with accession numbers CP060709 (ST18) and CP060708 (MFDpir)

The host ranges of the three plasmids have been previously documented as being broad (pBP136), narrow (pCAR1), and intermediate (NAH7) (13). A broad-host-range plasmid is proposed to be able to replicate itself and be maintained stably in at least two different bacterial classes without selection, whereas a narrow-host-range plasmid is in the same class or genus (13).

Modular structure of the plasmid genome. An example of the IncP-1 plasmid genome is shown. The replication module is the only element essential for plasmid maintenance. The other modules assist in plasmid maintenance. IncP-1β and IncP-1α are lineages of IncP-1 plasmids. Horizontal arrows indicate the direction of transcription. Each functional module is regulated by a transcriptional regulator encoded in the module block or global regulators encoded in the central control region [188,189].

Replication module. (A) Replication module of IncP-1 plasmids. Ssb encodes a single-strand DNA binding protein. trfA encodes the Rep protein. (B) Replication initiation of IncP-1 plasmid. Monomeric TrfA bound to iterons opens base pairs in the DUE, and then host DnaA or TrfA itself recruits DnaB onto the unwound DUE. TrfA molecules bind to single-stranded DNA to assist replisome assembly on one strand via direct interaction with β-clamp, starting unidirectional replication. Lagging strand synthesis is not shown for simplicity. Illustration follows [8], with minor modifications. (C) Replication inhibition by Rep protein dimer. Paired oriV can dissociate via proteolysis or an increased Rep protein monomer to dimer ratio [32].

薬剤耐性プラスミドの宿主適応

本現象の背景にある分子機構を解明するため、ある宿主集団内で進化した進化型プラスミドの配列を決定したのち、進化型プラスミドを先祖型宿主に戻す実験を行ったところ、プラスミド存続性の向上がプラスミド の複製タンパク質（TrfA1）のN末の変異に依存していることがわかりました。このTrfAのN末は宿主のDnaBヘリカーゼと結合する部位であることが知られていました。生化学、分子遺伝学実験の結果から、プラスミ ドが宿主の中で複製できる場合、「宿主のDNAヘリカーゼとプラスミドとの相互作用の度合いが、プラスミドの細菌集団内での存続性を決める要因の一つ、フィットネス・コストの正体である」ことがわかりました（Yano et al., Mol. Microbiol. 2016)。


プラスミドの種分化と宿主域

自然宿主の培養に依存しないプラスミド単離法の普及によって、伝達性プラスミドの集団内には遺伝子のレパートリーや並びが似ていても、ゲノムシグニチャーが顕著に異なる系統群が存在していることが明らかに なって来ました (Sen et al., Mol. Biol.Evol. 2013; Norberg et al., Nat. Comm. 2011)。そこで、「隔離による組換えの機会の減少によって種分化が進む」という生命進化の原則にもとづき、「ゲノムシグニチャーの異 なるプラスミドグループは、同じ不和合性群に属しても、宿主域が異なる」いう仮説を立て、その仮説が妥当であることを、実験によって示しました（Yano et al., Microbiol. 2013)。


タンパク質のN末の長さ多型の意義

上記の進化実験では、複製開始タンパク質に集中的に変異が入りましたが、類似の変異がデータベースに登録されている他のプラスミドにも見つかることに研究の過程で気づきました。そこで、得られた変異体プラ スミドの表現型を様々な角度から解析することで、 プラスミドに見られる複製開始タンパク質遺伝子の5’-endの長さの多様性（in/del) が、genetic driftではなくトレード・オフの関係にある形質（この場合は水平伝播 と垂直伝播）に対するnatural selectionの結果として説明できるというアイデアを提案しました（Yano et al., J. Bacteriol. 2012)。TrfAのN末の多型のような長さ多型は他のタンパク質（遺伝子座）にも見かけられま す。他のタンパク質に関しても、N末の長さ多型にには何か重要な意味があるのではないでしょうか。

Of the two IncP-1γ plasmids, both were unable to replicate in alphaproteobacterial host Sphingobium japonicum, and one established itself in Agrobacterium tumefaciens but was very unstable.

Introduction

Since Yakobson & Guiney (1983) proposed to separate plasmids RP4 and R751 as different subgroups (α, β) based on the sequence similarity in the transfer origin (Yakobson & Guiney, 1983), six IncP-1 subgroups (α, β, γ, δ, ϵ and ξ, see Fig. 1a) have been proposed based on the results of phylogenetic analysis for plasmid backbone genes (Jobanputra & Datta, 1974; Haines et al., 2006; Sen et al., 2010, 2013; Bahl et al., 2007; Norberg et al., 2011). To date, more than 55 IncP-1 plasmid sequences have been deposited in the NCBI database.

Plasmid transfer frequencies

When the alphaproteobacteria were used as recipients, no transfer was detected for either of the IncP-1γ plasmids from P. putida as donor, whereas pBP136Km was transferred successfully. When E. coli was the donor, transfer of the IncP-1γ plasmids to A. tumefaciens was detected, but at low to extremely low frequencies, and no transfer to S. japonicum was observed.

Plasmid pS28‐3 present in isolate S28 (floR, oxyS, enrS) is 48.922 kb, (Supporting Information Fig. S3A) and shares 99% identity to the environmental plasmid pSFA231 isolated from petroleum‐contaminated sediment in China (Li et al., 2015). The major difference between pS28‐3 and pSFA231 is that pS28‐3 contains an additional 7.3 kb transposon, Tn6351, which harbours the floR gene known to confer resistance to florfenicol (Table 1).
